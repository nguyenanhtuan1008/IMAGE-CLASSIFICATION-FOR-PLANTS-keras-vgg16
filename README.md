![Output](https://github.com/pangoro24/IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-FOR-PLANTS-keras-vgg16/blob/master/images/network.JPG "Test demo image")


## Goal:
Training and inference for plants dataset using keras vgg16 trained model

## Just for the record...
This is the Keras model of the 16-layer network used to classify images of 3 different kind of vegetables (pumpkin, tomato, watermelon)

## Reference:
- This demo was developed following the instructions from : https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/Keras-Fine-Tuning
- Dataset located at: https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/Keras-Fine-Tuning/clean-dataset

Note:
Results are ok locally. I trained the model with just a few epoches in the jupyter notebook.
